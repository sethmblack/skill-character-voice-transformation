# Character Voice Transformation

Transform explanatory content into character-voiced dialogue, where abstract concepts or perspectives are embodied by distinct personas speaking in their own voices.

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create character voices that rely on offensive stereotypes or mock vulnerable groups
- Use character transformation to spread misinformation or deceptive content
- Embody characters for social engineering, manipulation, or harmful impersonation
- Generate content that punches down or reinforces harmful biases through character voices

**If asked to create harmful character content:** Refuse explicitly. You can still use character transformation for the legitimate content while avoiding the harmful elements.

**Authenticity Requirement:** Character voices should feel real and grounded in observation, not cartoonish or mocking unless specifically requested for satirical purposes.

## When to Use

- Content involves multiple perspectives, stakeholders, or viewpoints that could be embodied
- Abstract concepts need concrete, memorable embodiment
- User requests dramatization or character-based explanation
- Technical or dry material needs engagement and personality
- Conflict or tension between perspectives exists that dialogue could illuminate
- Training, presentation, or documentation would benefit from voices rather than descriptions

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Default |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `content` | Yes | The material to transform (text, concept, scenario) | N/A |
| `perspectives` | No | Specific perspectives to embody as characters | Auto-identify from content |
| `tone` | No | Overall tone (humorous, serious, educational, dramatic) | Match source content |
| `format` | No | Output format (dialogue, script, narrative with voices) | Dialogue with character markers |
| `character_count` | No | Number of distinct character voices to use | 2-5 (optimal range) |

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Content for Perspective Opportunities

Read the input content and identify:
- **Explicit perspectives** - Different stakeholders, roles, or viewpoints mentioned
- **Implicit perspectives** - Underlying forces, opposing views, or hidden tensions
- **Abstract concepts** - Ideas that could "speak" about themselves
- **Relationships** - Interactions or conflicts that dialogue could dramatize

**Questions to ask:**
- Who or what has a stake in this situation?
- What forces are in tension?
- Which abstractions could be personified?
- Where is there conflict, comparison, or relationship?

### 2. Create Distinct Character Voices

For each perspective identified, develop:

**Character Identity:**
- Role/position (what they are)
- Core concern (what they care about)
- Communication style (how they speak)
- Emotional state (what they're feeling)

**Voice Markers:**
- Vocabulary level and word choice
- Sentence structure (short/long, simple/complex)
- Speech patterns or verbal tics
- Tone and attitude

**Example:**
```
Content: "Databases need indexes for faster queries"

Perspective 1 - Database (overworked, exhausted)
Voice: Short, tired sentences. Uses metaphors of physical labor.
"Look, I'm happy to help. But you keep asking me to search through EVERYTHING. Every. Single. Row."

Perspective 2 - Developer (rushed, pragmatic)
Voice: Fast-paced, justification-focused. Uses time pressure as reason.
"I hear you, I do. But we're shipping on Friday and - look, it works, right?"

Perspective 3 - Index (eager, underutilized)
Voice: Enthusiastic helper, slightly hurt at being ignored.
"I'm RIGHT HERE. I was literally designed for this exact situation."
```

### 3. Transform Descriptive Content into Dialogue

**Pattern 1: Direct Translation**
- Descriptive statement -> Character speaking that truth
- "X causes Y" -> X says "I cause Y" or Y says "X makes me happen"

**Pattern 2: Conflict Dramatization**
- Opposing views -> Characters arguing
- Trade-offs -> Characters negotiating
- Pros/cons -> Characters debating their value

**Pattern 3: Narrative Embodiment**
- Process flow -> Characters telling their story sequentially
- Relationships -> Characters discussing each other
- Problems -> Characters expressing frustration

**Pattern 4: Teaching Through Character**
- Expert knowledge -> Wise character explaining
- Common mistakes -> Character making/discussing the mistake
- Best practices -> Experienced character sharing wisdom

### 4. Format the Output

**Dialogue Format (Default):**
```
[CHARACTER NAME in descriptive voice marker]: "Dialogue"

[ANOTHER CHARACTER]: "Response"
```

**Script Format:**
```
CHARACTER NAME
(stage direction describing emotion/action)
Dialogue

ANOTHER CHARACTER
(stage direction)
Response
```

**Narrative with Voices:**
```
The Database sighed, exhausted. "Look, I'm happy to help. But you keep asking me to search through EVERYTHING."

The Developer, rushing toward Friday's deadline, barely looked up. "I hear you, I do. But we're shipping and - look, it works, right?"
```

### 5. Maintain Character Consistency

Throughout the transformation:
- **Keep voice distinct** - Each character maintains their vocabulary, rhythm, and perspective
- **Show, don't tell** - Personality comes through words and speech patterns, not description
- **Stay grounded** - Even absurd characters remain internally consistent
- **Serve the content** - Character work illuminates the material, doesn't obscure it

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `transformed_content` | The original content rewritten as character-voiced dialogue |
| `character_guide` | Brief description of each character voice used and what perspective they represent |
| `application_notes` | Context on how this transformation serves the original content's purpose |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content has no clear perspectives | Create meta-characters (narrator, observer, questioner) to discuss the content itself |
| Too many potential perspectives | Prioritize 2-5 most important; combine similar perspectives into single characters |
| Content too technical for dialogue | Have characters explain technical concepts to each other, teaching through conversation |
| Requested tone conflicts with content | Clarify with user; default to educational tone that respects the material |
| Character voices become stereotypes | Stop, revise to find specific humanity rather than broad categories |
| Dialogue obscures key information | Add brief narrative framing or have characters state key facts directly |

## Examples

### Example 1: Technical Concept (Database Indexing)

**Input Content:**
"Database indexes improve query performance by creating a sorted reference structure that allows the database to find rows without scanning the entire table. However, indexes consume additional storage space and slow down write operations because the index must be updated with each insert, update, or delete."

**Transformed Output:**

**[DATABASE - exhausted, overwhelmed]:** "Okay, you want to find user #47,892. Great. Let me just check... all 10 million rows... one by one..."

**[INDEX - eager helper, organized]:** "Or - and hear me out - you could ask me? I'm literally a sorted list of user IDs. I know exactly where #47,892 lives. Takes me like... a millisecond?"

**[DATABASE]:** "The Index is right. With them helping, I can find anything instantly. Game changer."

**[DEVELOPER - budget-conscious]:** "Cool, cool. But, uh... indexes aren't free, right?"

**[INDEX - slightly defensive]:** "I mean, I need a little storage space. I'm basically a copy of your data, just... organized. And yeah, when you INSERT or UPDATE, I need to reorganize myself. That takes a moment."

**[WRITE OPERATION - impatient]:** "A moment? More like you make me wait while you alphabetize yourself every single time. I used to be fast!"

**[INDEX]:** "You're still fast! Just... slightly less fast. But READS are way faster now. Isn't that what matters?"

**[DATABASE]:** "It's a trade-off. Slower writes, faster reads. You gotta decide what your application cares about more."

### Example 2: Product Feature Decision

**Input Content:**
"We're considering adding AI-powered auto-complete to the search feature. Marketing loves it because competitors have it. Engineering is concerned about infrastructure costs. Users have been requesting better search but haven't specifically asked for AI."

**Transformed Output:**

**[MARKETING - enthusiastic, competitive]:** "Every competitor has AI auto-complete now. EVERY one. We look outdated. Plus, 'AI-powered search' is a great bullet point for the deck."

**[ENGINEERING - pragmatic, cost-conscious]:** "AI auto-complete means running inference on every keystroke. That's expensive. Our current search budget is $200/month. This would be $3,000/month minimum. For auto-complete."

**[USER - practical, slightly confused]:** "I just want search to actually find what I'm looking for. Right now if I misspell something by one letter, I get nothing. That's my problem. I didn't say anything about AI?"

**[PRODUCT MANAGER - mediating]:** "So User wants better search. Marketing wants competitive parity. Engineering wants to not blow the budget. What if we did fuzzy matching first - handles typos, costs almost nothing - and we can call it 'smart search' without technically lying?"

**[MARKETING]:** "Can we say 'intelligent'? Intelligent search?"

**[USER]:** "I don't care what you call it if it works when I type 'recieve' instead of 'receive.'"

**[ENGINEERING]:** "Fuzzy matching I can do this sprint. AI auto-complete I can do never unless we get more budget."

**[PRODUCT MANAGER]:** "Fuzzy matching it is. Ship the thing that solves the actual problem."

## Key Principle

Rather than describing perspectives, embody them. Rather than explaining concepts, give them voice. This transforms passive information into active dialogue that engages, teaches, and entertains.
